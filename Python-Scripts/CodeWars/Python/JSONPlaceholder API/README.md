An **API** stands for **Application Programming Interface**, which is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.

* **Response**: What you get back from the API (e.g., { "temp": "15Â°C" })
* **Endpoint**: A specific URL where you send your request (e.g., /api/users)
* **HTTP Methods**:
	- `GET` (read data)
	- `POST` (create data)
	- `PUT/PATCH` (update data)
	- `DELETE` (remove data)
* **JSON:** Common format for sending/receiving data with APIs
