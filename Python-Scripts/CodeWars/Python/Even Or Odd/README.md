# Even or Odd

Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns `"Even"` for even numbers or `"Odd"` for odd numbers.

## Approach

Used `return` instead of `print()` due to recieving errors for `None`. The `print()` displays output to the console and does not return a value (implicitly returns None).
It is used mainly for debugging or user communication.
