# Get Planet Name

## Scenario

The function is not returning the correct values. Can you figure out why?

Example (Input --> Output ):

```
3 --> "Earth"
```

## Solution

The match-case statement in Python (introduced in Python 3.10) is useful in scenarios where multiple conditional checks need to be made against a single value. It improves readability, performance, and maintainability over traditional `if-elif-else` statements.
