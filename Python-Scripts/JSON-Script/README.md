# JSON Script

This script was created as part of the Cyber Defenders "Bucket" challenge to parse Cloud Trail Logs. The script accepts a Cloud Trail JSON log file as a command-line argument and then prints a selection of interesting fields.

Usage: 

```bash
python3 json-print.py CloudTrail-4.json
```
