1. List all the Canadian cities and their populations?

```sql
SELECT city, population FROM north_american_cities WHERE country = "Canada";
```

2. Order all the cities in the United States by their latitude from north to south?

```sql
SELECT * FROM north_american_cities WHERE country = "United States" ORDER BY latitude DESC;
```

3. List all the cities west of Chicago, ordered from west to east?

```sql
SELECT city, longitude FROM north_american_cities
WHERE longitude < -87.629798
ORDER BY longitude ASC;
```

4. List the two largest cities in Mexico (by population)?

```sql
SELECT * FROM north_american_cities
WHERE country = "Mexico"
ORDER BY population DESC
LIMIT 2;
```

5. List the third and fourth largest cities (by population) in the United States and their population?
