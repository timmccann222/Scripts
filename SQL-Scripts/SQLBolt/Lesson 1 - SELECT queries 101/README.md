# Lession 1 - SELECT queries 101

To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write **SELECT** statements, which are often colloquially refered to as _queries_.

Think of a table in SQL as a type of an **entity** (ie. Dogs), and each row in that table as a specific **instance** of that type (ie. A pug, a beagle, a different colored pug, etc). This means that the columns would then represent the **common properties** shared by all instances of that entity (ie. Color of fur, length of tail, etc).

## SELECT Statements

SELECT Statement Syntax:

```sql
SELECT column, another_column, â€¦
FROM mytable;
```

SELECT Statement to retrieve all Columns:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM mytable;
```

## Lession 1 Exercises

We will be using a database with data about some of Pixar's classic movies for most of our exercises. This first exercise will only involve the **Movies** table.
