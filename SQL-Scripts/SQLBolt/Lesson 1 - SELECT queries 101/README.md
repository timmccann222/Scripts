# Lession 1- SELECT queries 101

To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write **SELECT** statements, which are often colloquially refered to as _queries_.

think of a table in SQL as a type of an entity (ie. Dogs), and each row in that table as a specific instance of that type (ie. A pug, a beagle, a different colored pug, etc). This means that the columns would then represent the common properties shared by all instances of that entity (ie. Color of fur, length of tail, etc).
