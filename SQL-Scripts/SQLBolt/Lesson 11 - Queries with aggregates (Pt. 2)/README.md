# Lesson 11 - Queries with aggregates (Pt. 2)

If the **GROUP BY** clause is executed after the **WHERE** clause (which filters the rows which are to be grouped), then how exactly do we filter the grouped rows?

SQL allows us to do this by adding an additional **HAVING** clause which is used specifically with the **GROUP BY** clause to allow us to filter grouped rows from the result set. The **HAVING** clause constraints are written the same way as the WHERE clause constraints, and are applied to the grouped rows. 

```sql
SELECT group_by_column, AGG_FUNC(column_expression) AS aggregate_result_alias, â€¦
FROM mytable
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column
HAVING group_condition;
```

## Lesson 11 Exercises

For this exercise, you are going to dive deeper into Employee data at the film studio. Think about the different clauses you want to apply for each task.

| Role     | Name       | Building | Years Employed |
|----------|------------|----------|----------------|
| Engineer | Becky A.   | 1e       | 4              |
| Engineer | Dan B.     | 1e       | 2              |
| Engineer | Sharon F.  | 1e       | 6              |
| Engineer | Dan M.     | 1e       | 4              |
| Engineer | Malcom S.  | 1e       | 1              |
| Artist   | Tylar S.   | 2w       | 2              |
| Artist   | Sherman D. | 2w       | 8              |
| Artist   | Jakob J.   | 2w       | 6              |
| Artist   | Lillia A.  | 2w       | 7              |
| Artist   | Brandon J. | 2w       | 7              |
| Manager  | Scott K.   | 1e       | 9              |
| Manager  | Shirlee M. | 1e       | 3              |
| Manager  | Daria O.   | 2w       | 6              |

1. Find the number of Artists in the studio (without a HAVING clause)?

```sql
SELECT role, COUNT(*) as Number_of_artists
FROM employees
WHERE role = "Artist";
```

2. Find the number of Employees of each role in the studio?

```sql
SELECT role, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY role;
```

3. Find the total number of years employed by all Engineers?

```sql
SELECT role, SUM(years_employed)
FROM employees
GROUP BY role
HAVING role = "Engineer";
```
