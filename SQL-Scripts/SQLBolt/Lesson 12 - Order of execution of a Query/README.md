# Lesson 12 - Order of execution of a Query

Now that we have an idea of all the parts of a query, we can now talk about how they all fit together in the context of a complete query. Each query begins with finding the data that we need in a database, and then filtering that data down into something that can be processed and understood as quickly as possible. Because each part of the query is executed sequentially, it's important to understand the order of execution so that you know what results are accessible where.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column, AGG_FUNC(column_or_expression), …
FROM mytable
    JOIN another_table
      ON mytable.column = another_table.column
    WHERE constraint_expression
    GROUP BY column
    HAVING constraint_expression
    ORDER BY column ASC/DESC
    LIMIT count OFFSET COUNT;
```
